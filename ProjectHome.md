# DiaporamaCenter #

DiaporamaCenter is a Win32 application for digital signage, intended to small business.

With this software you can display information, advertising, or other content, on multiple display devices (LCD screens, rear projection systems...).
With less effort, because everything is controlled by a scheduler, and presentation can be automatically generated from local or remote data.

There are many exemples of use cases, these are a few ones:
  * display business information on a store window : for example, an estate agent could use it to show homes for sales information, retrieved from its database
  * display general information or news coming from the web for customers in a waiting area
